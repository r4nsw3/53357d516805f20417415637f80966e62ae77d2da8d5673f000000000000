  |   Art of Balance, one of the all-time best physics-puzzlers (88% on     |
  |   Metacritic.com) has finally made its way to Nintendo Switch.          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Puzzle games must be addictive. That's why we designed 200 levels     |
  |   to not only challenge your skills but also your imagination. With     |
  |   its tight controls, Art of Balance is easy to pick up and hard to     |
  |   put away.                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The goal sounds simple at first: Build a balanced stack from all      |
  |   given shapes, but there are plenty of challenges. Some shapes         |
  |   break under load, while others can even reverse gravity and           |
  |   literally turn the stack upside down. With practice, some             |
  |   experimentation and a little bit of luck however you'll quickly       |
  |   master even the most difficult challenges.                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Packed with 5 unique game modes, online play and local split-         |
  |   screen, Art of Balance is the ultimate test for aspiring puzzle       |
  |   masters. Three additional players can join in at any time and help    |
  |   you solve the puzzles.                                                |
